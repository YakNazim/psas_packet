PSAS Packet Serializer
======================

`Portland State Aerospace Society <http://psas.pdx.edu/>`_  PSAS is a student
aerospace engineering project at Portland State University. We are building
ultra-low-cost, open source rockets that feature some of the most sophisticated
amateur rocket avionics systems out there today.

In developing our `telemetry <https://github.com/psas/telemetry>`_ system we've
had to come up with a tight data storage and transfer technique. Our preferred
data scheme is called a PSAS packet.
